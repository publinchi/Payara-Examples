= A Demo Application for Payara Platform release 5.183

This applciation shows basic usage of some new features in the Payara Platform release 5.183, mostly additions in the MicroProfile API.

The following new features are demonstrated in this application:

* MicroProfile Config 1.3
** converters for classes with a String constructor, including `URI` and `URL`
** mapping of invalid characters in environment variables
* MicroProfile Type-Safe REST Client 1.1
** Asynchronous methods
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.1
** Automatic metrics for interceptors exposed via MicroProfile Metrics endpoints

## Run the application

This is a standard Maven WAR project. To compile it, just run:

```
mvn install
```

To run the application, you can either:

* deploy the built WAR artifact to Payara Server
* start it with Payara Micro on command line
* start the application on Payara Micro with Maven

To start with Maven, run:

```
mvn payara-micro:start
```

You should be able to access the following REST endpoints:

* http://localhost:8080/payara-webinar/ - a basic example for using an injected REST client interface
* http://localhost:8080/payara-webinar/prog - the same example but with the programmatic approach
* http://localhost:8080/payara-webinar/async - an example using the new support for asynchronous REST client methods
* http://localhost:8080/payara-webinar/fail - an example of calling a failing service handled by a fallback method
* http://localhost:8080/metrics - an example of metrics for the `@Retry` and `@Fallback` annotations (search for `application:ft_webinar_root_resource`). The output is in Prometheus format. Request JSON format with a Accept header with a REST client.
